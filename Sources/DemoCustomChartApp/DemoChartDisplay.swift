 This is the meat of the demonstration.
 
 It's a simple bar chart that displays a set of bars, across 71 days, that represent the total number of users of an app, with "active" ones, and "new" ones, separated by color.
 
 X-axis is date, and Y-axis is a simple, linear, number of users of the system.
